# ADR-010: RESERVED

## Status
RESERVED - Number not currently in use

## Context

This ADR number is reserved for future use. During the initial planning phase of the Go Coordination Engine, several architectural decisions were considered for documentation. Some of these decisions were:
- Integrated into existing ADRs (consolidation for better coherence)
- Deemed unnecessary after further analysis
- Postponed for future implementation

To maintain sequential ADR numbering and avoid confusion about missing documentation, this number is explicitly reserved.

## Decision

ADR-010 is reserved and may be used for future architectural decisions. When needed, this placeholder will be replaced with actual architectural documentation.

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Maintains sequential ADR numbering
- ✅ Prevents confusion about "missing" ADRs
- ✅ Documents the gap explicitly

### Negative
- ⚠️ Slightly clutters the ADR index with placeholder entries
